John Carpenter / Lost Themes
============================

We build this for our pals at Sacred Bones as promo for a John Carpenter release
they're putting out. (!!!) It's 100% front-end code, blending various youtube
clips together into a unique video experience that plays full-screen in the 
background of a page. 

It took a lot of tinkering to find settings that would allow this to happen â€” the
YouTube API settings are very specific, and certain techniques worked in certain
browsers. This is the final cobination that worked. 

The video will autoplay, but not the audio. If you want to see the project live 
with audio, go here:
