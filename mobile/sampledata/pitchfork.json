In a backwards way, Spanish punk band <a href=\"http:\/\/ohmourn.bandcamp.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mourn<\/a> prove this; none of their members are older than 18, and if they were a pop or hip-hop group, somehow this would be a talking point of far less interest. As far as guitar music goes, teens are typically either lauded as prodigies or punks, gawked at or given backhanded compliments for powering through a lack of technical skills. \"Silver Gold\", the volcanic closer on Mourn's upcoming <a href=\"http:\/\/capturedtracks.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Captured Tracks<\/a> debut, is undeniably youthful. They're not hiding their influences; these are musicians still in the discovery phase, channeling <a href=\"http:\/\/pitchfork.com\/artists\/1896-pj-harvey\/\" target=\"_blank\">PJ Harvey<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/pitchfork.com\/artists\/3829-sleater-kinney\/\" target=\"_blank\">Sleater-Kinney<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/pitchfork.com\/artists\/3986-sunny-day-real-estate\/\" target=\"_blank\">Sunny Day Real Estate<\/a> and other 90s titans who are life-altering upon first listening.<!--pagebreak--><\/p> <p>But this isn't <a href=\"http:\/\/pitchfork.com\/thepitch\/348-lukas-moodysson\/\" target=\"_blank\"><i>We Are the Best!<\/i><\/a> on wax. More importantly, the Catalonian quartet play with an unshakable conviction and a lack of self-consciousness, recording straight-to-tape, letting the harmonies bleed together and drums play at maxed-out levels. What Jazz Rodriguez and Carla Perez Vas are singing about is unclear, even in their rudimentary English (\"deliver me from heaven\" is the one lyric that peeks through the murk), but \"Silver Gold\" comes across as a love song about punk rock and having a long life in it ahead of you.<\/p> <p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"400\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https:\/\/w.soundcloud.com\/player\/?visual=true&url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F171534011&show_artwork=true\"><\/iframe> <\/p>\n","pubDate":"Tue, 28 Oct 2014 14:05:00 -0400","guid":"http:\/\/pitchfork.com\/reviews\/tracks\/17188-mourns-silver-gold\/"},{"title":"Drake: \"How Bout Now\"","link":"http:\/\/pitchfork.com\/reviews\/tracks\/17187-drake-how-bout-now\/","description":"\n<p>Nobody runs a victory lap like <a href=\"http:\/\/pitchfork.com\/artists\/27950-drake\/\" target=\"_blank\">Drake<\/a>.

But don't get too hung up on the goofy moniker: \"O'Clock\" is an elated jam that's right on time to soundtrack the impending Australian summer.<!--pagebreak--><\/p> <p>\"I'm sorry if I'm comin' on a little strong,\" Neumann sings, and you can see how that might be the case. The guy's got this quality about his voice that's explosively coarse. Later, he asserts that he feels so electric he could start a fire. He's got undeniable confidence and magnetism as a frontman, punching out every word he sings with a wild, unpredictable swagger. It's the perfect counterbalance to the track's prominent organ, which lays the mellow groundwork. This is the sound of hijinx on a beautiful day: a sunny, jangling choogle (with handclaps and tambourine) overtaken by a huge guitar solo and unhinged vocals.\u00a0<\/p> <p><iframe src=\"\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/hHEQvV69AQ4\" width=\"620\" height=\"345\" frameborder=\"0\"><\/iframe><\/p>\n","pubDate":"Mon, 27 Oct 2014 17:45:00 -0400","guid":"http:\/\/pitchfork.com\/reviews\/tracks\/17165-scotdrakula-oclock\/"},{"title":"Bully: \"Milkman\"","link":"http:\/\/pitchfork.com\/reviews\/tracks\/17186-bully-milkman\/","description":"\n<p>There's something inherently creepy about a profession when both <a href=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=MqTKOq8DmWU\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Aphex Twin<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=6ZrKAR32WKU\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">EMA<\/a> see fit to pay it tribute.
