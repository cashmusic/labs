Zen 
===

A play on the old CSS Zen Garden project. This is a project aimed at making
quick changes using only front-end CSS and JavaScript, theming an existing 
page using CASH Music embeds. 

The goal is for us to find new ideas and new ways to theme our embeds. They
should be as flexible as possible, so implementing this means we'll find new
ways to use them, new ways to theme them, and learn what additional hooks 
(JavaScript OR CSS) that might be needed.

Also it's fun.
